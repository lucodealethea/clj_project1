# Introduction to clj_project1



Scaffolding for a web project using Clojure language.

With two tools :

- [Leiningen][1] -build and dependency management tools


- [Ring][2]  -standard Clojure interface to web application container (HTTP request handler); it will map HTTP requests to Clojure function called as Leiningen dependency


Note: it doesn 't use in this project Servlets as known in Java Web development, even if ring-servlet could be used and produce such artefacts.

# WHY CLOJURE ?

A very structured way to understand and nail down the steps required to build the web app container, it can now be compiled into ClosureScript that is a JS coding

Metabase is a cool BI access all_dbms written in clojure

sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/lein
```

Install it now:

```
sudo /usr/bin/lein
```
# Next Steps:
